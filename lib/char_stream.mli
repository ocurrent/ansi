(** [of_string s] is a cursor at the start of [s]. *)

val to_string : t -> string
(** [to_string t] is the substring from [t] to the end of the input. *)

val skip : t -> t
(** [skip t] is the stream without its first character. [t] must be non-empty. *)

(** [skip_all t] is the empty stream at the end of [t]. *)

val find : t -> char -> t option
(** [find t c] is a stream from the first occurrence of [c] in [t], if any. *)

(** [avail t] is the number of remaining characters in the stream. *)

(** [is_empty t] is [avail t = 0]. *)

val next : t -> (char * t) option
(** [next t] is [Some (c, t2)], where [c] is the next character in the stream and [t2] is [skip t],

(** [equal a b] is [true] iff the streams [a] and [b] are at the same offset in the same base string. *)

val string_of_span : span -> string
(** [string_of_span (s, a, b)] is the sub-string of [s] from [a] to [b]. *)
